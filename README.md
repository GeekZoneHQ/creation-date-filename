This simply takes the creation date of the file and renames the same file with that date on the start. This is useful as
some camera manufacturers (looking at you *GoPro*) use a seemingly random number for their filenames, which is utterly
useless. Using an ISO8601 datetime ensures that the file is ordered correctly in the file list, as well as the timeline
of your favourite non-linear video editor.
